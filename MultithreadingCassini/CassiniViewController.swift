/*
 So after running Ui was getting stuck when trying to rotate my Ui was just blank doing nothing
 So our UI is completely stuck
 No matter where I touch even if I rotate nothinhg happened
 Well this ia horrendous experience for your user
 This is the kind of experience that will cause your user to go and delete app
 Because you cannot have your UI freezing up so that's why we have multi threaded as such an important piece of the kind of app development do in iOS
 So lets fix this with multi threading
