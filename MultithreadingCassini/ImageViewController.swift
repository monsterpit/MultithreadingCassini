//easier in code than IB

//zooming
//set min and max zoom scale
//provide a delegate that says which is a view to zoom
//now it's obvious which view we want the transform to work on here its our imageView


//option key + drag in simulator to pinch 



/*
 We need to give them feedback we are off getting something
 To let them know  yeah I am working on it
 Even though you hit back you could stay here and you cansee your earth image
 
 So how gonna we do it ?
 We gonna do it with little spinner ... called an activity indicator
 It's a little spinning view and this is the one to show you for another reason too which is that it can sometime get a little crowded trying to build your Ui you want.
 especially when things go all  the way to the edges like this scrollView
 
 So this spinner it's called UI Activity indicator View
